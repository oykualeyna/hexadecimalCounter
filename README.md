# hexadecimalCounter
This project involves using the STM32 Nucleo-144 development board with the STM32F767ZI MCU to control a common cathode 7-segment display.
Board: STM32 Nucleo-144 development board with STM32F767ZI MCU

7-segment Display Type: Common Cathode.

Software IDE: STM32CubeIDE.

Programming Language: C

Application Purpose: The goal of this experiment is to design and implement a two-button system paired with a seven-segment display to simulate a hexadecimal counter. Button 1 is used to increment the counter, while Button 2 is used to decremnt it. This setup has practical applications, such as sports score tracking, where it simplifies the process of manually keeping scores and enables quick corrections in case of errors. By creating this application, we aim to demonstrate an efficient, user-friendly, and cost-effective method for managing numerical data.
